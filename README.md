All work here is in the public domain. You can use it however you want. You don't have to give me any credit when you re share it. You can literally copy it line by line and say it's yours, I don't care.

Now that that's over with, I'm going to share a list of links that have to do with PSX development.

Some of these are not in English. Google translate can help you translate them. It's not perfect but it works, I guess. For the images. For the diagrams and the images, Google Translate can't translate them. However, if you have the app on your phone, you could take a picture of the images and it will actually locate the characters in the image and replace them with English which is kind of cool.

I will also be writing a script that takes all of these websites and saves them to a folder where then I will push them to this repo. This is because whenever I found links on the internet regarding any sort of "retro" tech, they have an extremely high chance of being dead. Which is sad. So with saving them in a local directory while they are still alive and putting it on Github, I will be, in essence, preserving them.

Remember that these links might have a lot of misleading information so take all of them with a grain of salt. I have very little knowledge about the PSX. I just started and I'm pretty much using this for myself and my friends. But I wanted other people to have a chance to see it as well because it might be a bit useful.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork this and send me a PR.

Anyways, to the links.
